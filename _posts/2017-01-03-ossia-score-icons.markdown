Icons made for the open source project [ossia score](https://github.com/OSSIA/score), used for the different process categories: 
(from left to right)
- Audio
- Auomations
- Controls
- Filters
- GFX
- Midi
- Script
- Structure
- UI

The main difficulty was that icons were quite small 16 x 16 pixels, so fitting just the necessary information was the key.

    <figcaption style="text-align:center">Icons on the left list and displayed also on the right</figcaption>

The image below shows the icon in 16x16, the image on the top is the retina version (32x32).
