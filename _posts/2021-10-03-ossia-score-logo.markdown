Making of the logo for [ossia score](https://github.com/OSSIA/score), an open source project for an interactive intermedia sequencer for audio visual artists. 
The main goal was to create a modern logo with the notion of time and taking hint in the elements of the software UI. This timeline shows the process of the creation, which was a collective effort as I constantly asked for feedback from the project team. The best improvement was the second last one which was a simplification I did have in mind from the beginning but was not brave enough to actually try it. 

<div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-container timeline-right">
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Old logo</h2>
      <p>This was the previous logo for ossia score (named i-score at the time), using UI elements.</p>

  <div class="timeline-container timeline-left">
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>First draft</h2>
      <p>First draft using the UI color palette and combining three elements of the UI: the <b>trigger</b> (<img src="/assets/score_logo/trigger.svg" height="32px" width="auto">), the <b>state</b> (<img src="/assets/score_logo/state.svg" height="32px" width="auto">) and the <b>condition</b> (<img src="/assets/score_logo/cond.svg" height="32px" width="auto">) . I liked that it looked like a stopwatch reminding the time element.</p>

    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>First proposition</h2>
       <p>Sent this version to the the project team: color variation and improved the bottom line to a make it look more "finished".</p>

  <div class="timeline-container timeline-left">
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Dash element</h2>
      <p>One of the feedback from the team was to incoporate the dash line to the logo as it is important in the UI.</p>

      <h2>Adding shadow</h2>
      <p>Removed the borders and added shadow.</p>

  <div class="timeline-container timeline-left">
    <div class="timeline-content">
      <h2>Gradient</h2>
      <p>Changed the color scheme, added a gradient to add more depth and added the white border to make it look coherent with OSX icons.</p>

      <h2>Best improvement: </h2>
      <p>I was pointed out that the top part was not necessarily and without it, it would look much better, reminding the "O" from ossia: it does remove symbolism as the UI element are less recognizable but as a logo it is much better, simple and aesthetically satisfying.</p>

      <h2>Final result</h2>
      <p>Finally I removed the white border and the surrounding shadow as it was only to be coherent with OSX icons, which is a not a priority and on other media it looked more elegant without it.</p>
