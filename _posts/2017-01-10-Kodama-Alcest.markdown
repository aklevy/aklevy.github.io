I drew an image based on the album Kodama by Alcest, it is very much inspired by the work of the japanese artist Yamamoto Takato (whom I have done two reproductions of his work <a href="magus">The Magus</a> and <a href="saintsebastian">Saint Sebastian</a>). I used the open source software Krita but I have to admit I struggled quite a lot as it was my first digital drawing. 

Below is my draft drawn with pencil, and eventhough I do like the final result of the digital drawing, I think that this draft has more raw attractiveness.
