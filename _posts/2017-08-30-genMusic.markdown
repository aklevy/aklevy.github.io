[genMusic](https://github.com/aklevy/genMusic) is a projet for an instrument, played using mouse input and/or HotHand and the software [Score](https://ossia.io/). The graphics are roughly inspired by the works of Swiss graphic designer Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann, and more precisely by his posters for Musica Viva.
