Open source project with [jcelerier](https://github.com/jcelerier), we implemented controls useful in creative coding in Qt/QML (sliders, joystick, keyboard, graph, etc.) : [https://github.com/jcelerier/qml-creative-controls/](https://github.com/jcelerier/qml-creative-controls/).


I contributed in the development of controls and graphic design (logo and icons displayed in the QtCreator's Designer).
