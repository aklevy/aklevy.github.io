<a href="magus">Another reproduction</a> of Yamamoto Takato's work: this time it is his work 'Saint Sebastian', and more precisely the left half of the painting (this is why Saint Sebastian is missing on my drawing since he is drawn on the right half of the original artwork). I used watercolor, black ink for the turban in the middle and black pen for the line contour. I am not used to water color but it was fun and also very relaxing, as I really love the original artwork, the drawing process was very pleasing to my eyes.
